# LiveAvatar × GPT-Live — スロット会話デモ

A Japanese voice-conversation demo: **OpenAI GPT-Live** (a full-duplex
speech-to-speech model) drives a **HeyGen LiveAvatar** in realtime. This is a
customized version of HeyGen's official reference integration.

Out of the box it is **Rina, a friendly Japanese-speaking slot companion**.
This milestone focuses on natural voice conversation; it does not yet receive
reel video or game-result events. The persona is defined in two markdown files
under `server/prompts/`.

Barebones on purpose: the wiring is the thing you read, not a framework around
it. Fork it, swap the persona, keep the face.

The browser never holds an API key. It gets a LiveKit token to watch the
avatar, and a websocket for mic audio (up) and transcripts + visuals (down).
The avatar's voice takes the short path: GPT-Live → orchestrator → media
server, with the browser out of the loop.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Node ≥ 20.12, pnpm, a [LiveAvatar API key](https://app.liveavatar.com),
and an OpenAI API key with GPT-Live access (generally available; this
integration speaks the v3 contract, `gpt-live-1`).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run setup   # prompts for the two API keys, verifies each, writes .env
pnpm dev         # server on :8787, web on :5173
```

`pnpm run setup` walks you through it: it asks for each key (with the URL to
create one), verifies it against the live API before accepting it, and writes
`.env` at the repo root. Safe to re-run — existing values are kept and
re-verified, not re-asked. (The `run` matters: bare `pnpm setup` is pnpm's own
built-in command.)

Prefer doing it by hand? `cp .env.example .env` and fill it in. Either way,
`pnpm dev` and `pnpm start` check the required variables before starting and
name exactly what's missing.

No avatar to pick, no prompt to write: a default avatar id ships in
`.env.example` (swap `LIVEAVATAR_AVATAR_ID` for one of your own, or unset it
and the server uses the first public avatar and logs which), and the persona
ships in `server/prompts/`.

Open http://localhost:5173 → **会話をはじめる** → allow the mic → talk. Rina
greets you in Japanese and asks which slot machine you are playing.

To change what the demo is: edit `server/prompts/instructions.md` (who the
avatar is) and `server/prompts/greeting.md` (how it opens), restart the
server. An empty `greeting.md` means the user speaks first.

## Troubleshooting a fresh clone

**"Missing required env: …" when you run `pnpm dev`.** The preflight check
(`scripts/check-env.mjs`) refuses to start until the required variables are
set, and names them. Run `pnpm run setup` — it prompts for each key and
verifies it against the live API — or fill in `.env` by hand. The server also
re-checks per session (`/api/session/start` 500s naming what's absent), so a
deployment with broken ambient env explains itself too. The server reads
`.env` only at startup.

**A key that doesn't work.** `pnpm run setup` verifies both keys before saving
them, so a typo or revoked key fails there with a pointer to the right
dashboard — re-run it any time keys change.

**The avatar appears and blinks but never speaks.** LiveAvatar is up; GPT-Live
isn't. Almost always a bad `OPENAI_API_KEY` or no GPT-Live access on the
account. Set `GPT_LIVE_DEBUG=1` and restart to watch every upstream event
(audio elided) — a session that authenticates but errors will say why.

**Any other error on Start.** Upstream error bodies are passed through
verbatim on purpose — a 401 from LiveAvatar or OpenAI means that key; read the
message, it is the real one.

**It speaks but never hears you.** The status line under the stage says
`microphone unavailable` if permission was denied — re-allow it in the
browser's site settings and Start again. There is no push-to-talk and no VAD:
the mic streams continuously (meter next to the status line) and the model
decides when you're done talking.

**No greeting when the session opens.** An empty `server/prompts/greeting.md`
is a feature, not a bug: it means "say nothing, let the user speak first".

**Port 8787 is taken.** Set `PORT` in `.env` — and mirror it in
`web/vite.config.ts`, whose dev proxy points at `:8787`. (Vite itself moving
off 5173 is fine; the proxy target is the only coupling.)

## What's in the box

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `shared/messages.ts` | The wire protocol — every message both sides speak, typed once |
| `shared/tools.ts` | The tool registry — schemas the model sees, co-located with their arg types |
| `server/prompts/*.md` | The persona — edit these to change what the demo is |
| `server/src/prompts.ts` | Loads the persona; holds the delegation/tool mechanics prompts |
| `server/src/gptlive.ts` | The GPT-Live v3 bridge: session start, audio, transcripts, tool calls |
| `server/src/turns.ts` | Turn projection over v3 transcript deltas — the API has no turn events |
| `server/src/mediaServer.ts` | The avatar's ear: LITE media-server websocket |
| `server/src/session.ts` | Wires the legs together; owns barge-in |
| `web/src/livekitRoom.ts` | Joins the room, attaches the avatar's video + audio |
| `web/src/micCapture.ts` | AudioWorklet → 24kHz PCM16 base64 (no VAD — the model owns turn-taking) |
| `web/src/overlays/` | The single switch over `widget`; one renderer per widget |
| `web/public/overlays/term-card.html` | The overlay composition (a self-contained animated page) |

recipe).

## How tool calls become visuals

1. The live model holds **no tools**. When a visual is wanted it delegates the
   turn to its backend Responses model — which does hold them
   (`shared/tools.ts`).
2. The Responses model answers in words **and** calls e.g. `show_term_card` in
   the same reply. The words are injected back into the live session and
   spoken; the tool call surfaces on the orchestrator's socket.
3. The orchestrator validates the call (`server/src/tools.ts`) and forwards
   one `{ type: "ui", widget, props }` message to the browser. Term cards are
   also recorded per-session — `show_learned_words` renders the recap from
   that server-side store, so the list is never the model's to get wrong.
4. The browser's widget switch (`web/src/overlays/`) plays the matching
   composition — a transparent animated page layered over the avatar's video.
   Staging is per-widget: the term card overlays the full-frame avatar, the
   recap panel shrinks it to the corner. Nothing is composited into the
   stream itself.

Adding a tool is three small edits — see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Iterating on overlays

Render a widget without burning session minutes — from the browser console:

```js
window.__ui({ widget: "term_card", props: { term: "こんにちは", reading: "kon-ni-chi-wa", meaning: "hello" } })
window.__ui({ widget: "learned_words", props: { title: "Words so far", words: [{ term: "こんにちは", reading: "kon-ni-chi-wa", meaning: "hello" }, { term: "お茶", reading: "o-cha", meaning: "tea" }] } })
```

## Production notes

This is a starter, not a deployment. Before exposing it publicly: add auth on
`/api/session/start` and the websocket upgrade, hide upstream error bodies,
and read the hardening list in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#production-hardening).
